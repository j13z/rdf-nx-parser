# Tests

Since this is a *non-validating* parser, the tests here only strive to ensure that valid syntax will be parsed properly. It should also handle “noisy” data, but that’s not guaranteed (“best effort”).

This is opposed to the [W3C test suite] [1], which expects an implementation to fail on invalid input (“negative tests”).

A few test inputs here were taken from the W3C test suit.
